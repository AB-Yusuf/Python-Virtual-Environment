# Python-Virtual-Environment
Developing python applications regularly requires the creation and activation of a python virtual environment. Reducing the stress of habitual googling of this process, I created a quick reference guide on creating a python virtual environment and activating it using Visual Studio Code (Windows). 

Steps

1.) Click on the link:
https://github.com/AB-Yusuf/Python-Virtual-Environment/blob/master/A%20Quick%20Lookup%20Guide%20To%20Creating%20A%20Python%20Virtual%20Environment%20and%20Activating%20it%20using%20Visual%20Studio%20Code%20(Windows%20).pdf

2.) Click on the download button, to download the pdf file.

3.) View downloaded file on your system.



Star the repo if you find the guide quite handy and helpful.
